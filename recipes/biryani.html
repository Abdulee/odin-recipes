         <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
         <li>3 tomatoes, chopped</li>
         <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
         <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil or ghee</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons biryani masala</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon garlic paste</li>
         <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
         <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
         <li>1/4 teaspoon saffron threads, soaked in 2 tablespoons warm milk</li>
         <li>4 cups water</li>
         <li>Salt to taste</li>
         <li>Fresh cilantro leaves for garnish</li>
         <li>Fried onions for garnish (optional)</li>
         <li>Chopped mint leaves for garnish</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
         <li><strong>Prepare the Rice:</strong> Rinse the soaked basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the rice and cook until it's 70% done. Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
         <li><strong>Marinate the Meat:</strong> In a bowl, mix the yogurt, biryani masala, ginger paste, garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Add the meat pieces (or vegetables) to the marinade, ensuring they are well coated. Allow the meat to marinate for at least 30 minutes or longer for enhanced flavor.</li>
         <li><strong>Sauté Onions and Tomatoes:</strong> In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and release their juices.</li>
         <li><strong>Cook the Meat:</strong> Add the marinated meat (or vegetables) to the skillet with onions and tomatoes. Cook until the meat is browned and partially cooked through.</li>
         <li><strong>Layer the Biryani:</strong> In the same skillet, spread half of the partially cooked rice evenly over the meat. Sprinkle half of the saffron milk over the rice. Layer the remaining rice on top. Drizzle the remaining saffron milk over the rice. Cover the skillet with a tight-fitting lid.</li>
         <li><strong>Dum Cooking:</strong> Place the skillet over low heat and cook the biryani on dum (steam) for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and the meat is tender. You can also place a heavy object on top of the lid to seal it tightly and prevent steam from escaping.</li>
         <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Once the biryani is cooked, remove it from heat and let it rest for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves, chopped mint leaves, and fried onions if desired. Serve hot with raita (yogurt sauce) or your favorite condiments. Enjoy the tantalizing flavors of this aromatic biryani, a true culinary masterpiece from South Asia!</li>
