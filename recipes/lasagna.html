         <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
         <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
         <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
         <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
         <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
         <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
         <li>2 cups milk</li>
         <li>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
         <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
         <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
         <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
         <li><strong>Cook the Noodles:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
         <li><strong>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</strong> In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and minced garlic, sauté until they are soft and translucent. Add the ground beef and Italian sausage to the skillet. Cook until browned, breaking it up into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon. Drain excess fat if necessary. Pour in the marinara sauce and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
         <li><strong>Prepare the Béchamel Sauce:</strong> In a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add flour and whisk continuously until the mixture turns golden brown, about 2 minutes. Gradually pour in the milk while whisking constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and cook until it thickens, about 5-7 minutes. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
         <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna:</strong> In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom. Place three lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, slightly overlapping them. Spread a layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, followed by a layer of béchamel sauce. Sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese and shredded mozzarella cheese over the béchamel sauce. Repeat this layering process two more times, ending with a layer of meat sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
         <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
         <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired. Serve hot and enjoy the comforting flavors of this classic Italian dish with your loved ones. Buon appetito!</li>
