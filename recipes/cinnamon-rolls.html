         <h2>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>For the Dough:</li>
            <li>1 cup warm milk (about 110°F)</li>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>For the Filling:</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>For the Cream Cheese Frosting:</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
         </ul>


         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li><strong>Activate the Yeast:</strong> In a small bowl, combine warm milk and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the mixture is foamy.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the activated yeast mixture, sugar, melted butter, eggs, and salt. Gradually add flour, mixing until a soft dough forms.</li>
            <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Alternatively, knead the dough in the stand mixer for the same duration.</li>
            <li><strong>Rise the Dough:</strong> Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a small bowl, mix together softened butter, brown sugar, and ground cinnamon until well combined.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll out the Dough:</strong> Once the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out on a floured surface into a large rectangle, about 16x20 inches in size.</li>
            <li><strong>Spread the Filling:</strong> Spread the prepared cinnamon filling evenly over the rolled-out dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll the Dough:</strong> Starting from the long edge, tightly roll the dough into a log. Pinch the seam to seal.</li>
            <li><strong>Cut into Rolls:</strong> Using a sharp knife or a piece of dental floss, cut the dough log into 12 equal-sized rolls.</li>
            <li><strong>Arrange in a Pan:</strong> Place the rolls in a greased 9x13 inch baking dish, leaving a little space between each roll for expansion.</li>
            <li><strong>Rise Again:</strong> Cover the rolls with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let them rise in a warm place for another 30-45 minutes, or until they double in size.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Once the rolls have risen, bake them in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes or until they are golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the Frosting:</strong> While the rolls are baking, prepare the cream cheese frosting. In a mixing bowl, beat together softened butter, cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and salt until smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li><strong>Ice the Rolls:</strong> Once the rolls are done baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Spread the cream cheese frosting generously over the warm rolls.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the cinnamon rolls warm and gooey, savoring each delightful bite of cinnamon-spiced sweetness. Enjoy these irresistible treats with a cup of coffee or a tall glass of cold milk for the ultimate indulgence!</li>
